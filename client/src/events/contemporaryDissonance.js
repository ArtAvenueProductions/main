        "Under the increasing awareness of the interconnectivity and globalization of the 21st century, art historians have begun to critically examine our much traditional and out of date view on the history of art. No longer are they adopting the Euro-American centric model that delineates a singular narrative of art history, which perhaps excluded and ignored much of the rest of the world. Scholars are now identifying that there exists and have existed multiple narratives that lie in conjunction with the Euro-American model.",
        "Arts coming from the region outside of Euro-America were contextualized and decontextualized into a western narrative. Countries such as China were perceived in a strictly “East/West” dichotomy that emphasized the West’s modernity and the East’ s tradition. Chinese art, especially the arts coming from mainland, were seen as stuck in the past and even China’s modern artists were perceived as derivatives of their western counterparts. Scholarship nowadays, have given light to the histories and narratives of each region and culture while highlighting the equally modern and contemporary efforts of artists around the world. No longer do we see China’s modern movement as a derivative of the Euro-American one, which came at a much later time than the latter."

      body: [
        "With the hyper-globalization felt in every corner of the world, a new generation of artists have emerged, eager to express the contemporaneity they have experienced in their everyday lives. Contemporary Dissonance is an exhibition like that of an experimental laboratory and artist playground, inviting young and emerging artists to showcase their own understanding of contemporaneity. No longer do these artists see histories of art and narratives as just intersecting and crossing over, but rather as a fluid and dynamic exchange that almost erases all sense of established identities and locales. They question the “East/West” dichotomy but moreover, they question the establishment of multiple narratives and histories: how do you separate one cultural identity from the other when the world you have experienced is fluid and dynamic? The four artists in this exhibition, Katusha Jin, Eric Lau, Yvonne Kwok, Jessica Zheng, all from different backgrounds and upbringings, question the very narrative of art and experience in their own works. Through the different media of painting, fashion and photography, there seems to be this common thread that links these artists together -- a rejection of pre-existing labels and identities while also a sense of uneasiness as they fail to find an identity they can associate with. The result is an exhibition of works from these artists that seem to voice a contemporary dissonance to the currently established narratives and identities."
